If you have reviewed, please read and decide whether to transfer the license to your reviewing data for this iteration of ARR.\n\n*** DISCLAIMER ***\nYour participation is strictly voluntary. By transferring this license you grant ACL the right to distribute the text of your review. In particular, we may include your review text and scores in research datasets without revealing the OpenReview identifier that produced the review. Keep in mind that as with any text, your identity might be approximated using author profiling techniques. Only reviews for accepted papers will be eventually made publicly available. The authors of the papers will have to agree to the release of the textual review data associated with their papers.\n",
